**Gobfs** (Go Bloom Filter Structure) is a package built in Go that uses bloom's filter to validate if a specific username is definitely not present in a dataset.  

## What's a Bloom Filter

> A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set".

## Why use gobfs

With gobfs, you can quickly check a username against our hand-picked dataset to make sure it's cool with community rules. That way, we all get to hang out in a safer space. We're always tweaking our dataset to keep up with the latest tricks from the bad guys.

## Install

With a [correctly configured](https://go.dev/doc/install#testing) Go toolchain:

```
go get -u github.com/ecorreiax/gobfs
```

## Examples

Kick things off by passing a username string to the `Check()` method. This returns a boolean, tipping you off if the username is invalid or not.

```go
func createUser() {
  u := "username"
  invalid := gobfs.Check(u)
  if invalid {
   // abort creation
  }
  // continue creation
}
```
